```javascript
import { BrowserRouter, Routes, Route } from 'react-router-dom';

function App() {
  return (
    <BrowserRouter>
      <Routes>
        <Route path="/" element={<Home />} />
        <Route path="/about" element={<About />} />
        <Route path="/users/:id" element={<User />} />
      </Routes>
    </BrowserRouter>
  );
}

export default App;
```
This code uses `react-router-dom` to define routes.  The issue occurs if a user tries to navigate to a URL that doesn't match any defined routes and there's no fallback route (e.g., a `Route` with `path="*"`).  This results in an empty screen with no error message.  The user experiences a 'silent' 404, making debugging difficult.
